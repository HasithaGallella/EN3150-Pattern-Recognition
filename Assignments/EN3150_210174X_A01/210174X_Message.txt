Dear Sir,

I have completed all the answers for my assignment in a Jupyter notebook, including code sections and detailed explanations. My submission PDF is a direct conversion from the notebook, but there are some LaTeX rendering issues with the equations involving the dollar sign ($) in my answers. 

If there is any confusion regarding the answers, please refer to the Jupyter notebook in the attached zip file. For convenience, Iâ€™ve also made it publicly accessible through this Google Colab link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Mn4ANUnovqzzPuARKSPGzk4HJh_M-Rve?usp=sharing. 

Thank you.
